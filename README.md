# 📰 Fake News Detection

A machine learning project aimed at classifying news articles as **real** or **fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory intended for storing datasets.

## 📦 Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install them using:

```bash```

pip install -r requirements.txt


*Note: Create a requirements.txt file with the above libraries listed.

🚀 Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/RanadiWijaya/FakeNewsDetection.git
cd FakeNewsDetection
Place your dataset in the data/ directory.

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
Follow the notebook cells to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

🧠 Model Overview
The project utilizes NLP techniques for text preprocessing, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines can be applied for classification tasks.

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is assessed using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

🔧 Future Enhancements
Incorporate advanced models like BERT or RoBERTa for improved accuracy.

Develop a web interface using Streamlit or Flask for user interaction.

Integrate real-time news feeds for live fake news detection.
